# Hashes

These are hashes for important documents that I want to archive. Generally,
they are things I have written but want to keep to myself until a later
date (maybe forever). Some entries are parts of my diary I want to be
able to share, others are predictions of future events I want to
pre-register. The rest are miscallenous documents.
