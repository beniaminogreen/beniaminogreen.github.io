      <description>About Me I am an incoming pre-doctoral fellow at the Yale Tobin Center for Economic Policy. I work on causal inference and machine learning.
Previously, I received a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Social Analysis and Research from Brown University, and a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in Politics, Philosophy and Economics with a concentration in Quantitative Methods from the University College London.</description>

      <description>Introduction GNU Make is a computer program long known to computer scientists, but tragically underused in the social sciences. Originally developed to manage the compilation of C/C++ code, Make can be used to automate the running of your data analysis code whenever changes are made. This automation will save time (code is run if and only if its dependencies are updated), eliminate a common class of errors (code is never run using old data or calculations), and free up your head space to focus on more important things.</description>

      <description>Zoomerjoin   zoomerjoin is an R package that empowers you to fuzzy-join massive datasets rapidly, and with little memory consumption. It is powered by high-performance implementations of Locality Sensitive Hashing, an algorithm that finds the matches records between two datasets without having to compare all possible pairs of observations. In practice, this means zoomerjoin can fuzzily-join datasets days, or even years faster than other matching packages. zoomerjoin has been used in-production to join datasets of hundreds of millions of names in a few hours.</description>
