      <description>Introduction GNU Make is a computer program long known to computer scientists, but tragically underused in the social sciences. Originally developed to manage the compilation of C/C++ code, Make can be used to automate the running of your data analysis code whenever changes are made. This automation will save time (code is run if and only if its dependencies are updated), eliminate a common class of errors (code is never run using old data or calculations), and free up your head space to focus on more important things.</description>
