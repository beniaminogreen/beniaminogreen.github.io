Photos from my recent trip to Iceland.

<!--more-->

I thought it would be fun to try and do some analog photography on my recent trip to Iceland. On a whim, I picked up an [Argus C3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_C3) for around $30 on Ebay, and gave it ago. There were some challenges getting the camera working but I am very happy with the results for my first ever time shooting film, and would absolutely reccomend the camera to anyone curious about analog photography.
